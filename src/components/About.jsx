          I'm a full stack developer from Portugal, I‚Äôm a very communicative and
          sociable person, with good power of argumentation who loves to talk.
          I'm always looking forward to new learning experiences. I have always
          had a curiosity about the tech world, for example, I‚Äôve always asked
          myself ‚Äúhow does a website work?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow can people make websites‚Äù.
          This curiosity increased with time plus the fact that I have friends
          working in this area who told me to try. In 2022 I decided to join
          Ironhack, and make a Web Development Bootcamp.

          With this bootcamp I expanded my knowledge in both backend and
          frontend technologies. I also acquired some SCRUM skills during the
          bootcamp.

          WORK EXPERIENCE üßëüèº‚Äçüíª I worked at a motorcycle shop in the parts
          department for almost two years, and then I got a job in the delivery
          area, delivering meat at a butcher shop. Thanks to these experiences I
          got really good at communicating with people and working with
          timelines.
